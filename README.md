## Overview
Panoptic Segmentation is a powerful technique that merges semantic segmentation (assigning a class to each pixel) with instance segmentation (identifying individual object instances). This project explores its implementation and application.

### Applications:
- Autonomous Vehicles (e.g., obstacle and lane detection)
- Robotics
- Aerial Imagery Analysis
- Medical Imaging

## Features
- Handles both **thing** (objects) and **stuff** (background) classes.
- Implements state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for segmentation.
- Built with modular code for scalability and experimentation.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thedarpanantala/Panoptic-Segmentation.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Panoptic-Segmentation
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
